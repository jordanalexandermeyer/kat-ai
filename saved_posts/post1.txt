- Synthesis:



Ok, so far so good.



In terms of my interactions with my SO:



We have been in 13 different countries, dating back to when I was growing up. I have a detailed account of each country's government and services, access to health care, education, job creation, and more. 



In terms of my interactions with my SO:



We don't have a detailed itinerary of our respective countries, so this is just a "beginner's" look at what's possible in each country. 



I love how in some Asian countries like Singapore, Vietnam, and even China, there are multiple "chapters" of government that are open to modification. In Colombia, the chapters on justice, human rights, and human infrastructure are extant. 



I love how in some of my SO countries, the chapters on human rights and infrastructure are not.

And still, still does not feel that happy. 







P.S. This past weekend, I submitted 1 beautiful likes from a single Instagram picture. It's been 25 days and I think it was worth the time (and money) to finish it and add it to my Instagram profile.



A few days ago, I got hooked on yoga and was inspired to create my own perfectionism when I sculpted my face. Last weekend, I had a new obsession with the journal: pencil sharpening. Next week, I'll take a break and write down my thoughts on the matter with a pen. After, I can write down the things that I'm thankful for and dislike about myself and those those those thoughts and feelings.



It's been 25 days and I'm finally done with this. Here's what I know:



When I write down things that I'm thankful for and dislike about myself, I end up saying more about myself. I know that I can't hold onto everything because I may forget or don't create a sense of identity with every acquisition. Thus, my gratitude feels like a flow I have.



For example, when I write down things that I'm thankful for and dislike about myself, I also end up saying more about myself. I think I'll make more productive use of my time in creating my thoughts and noticing myself. 



Another example I had in mind was when I write down things that I like and dislike, I can add to them, and feel free to add in others! 



Hands are easy to scratch, play with, and combine into a whole. 



Softens. Helps. Helps everyone.



Cheers,
