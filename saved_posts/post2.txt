It's not always easy to impress the clients you're working with

I'm often asked what it is that you're doing differently.



It's often said that clients are notoriously hard working. 



Well, it's not always true. Some of the hard work is the result of a combination of good times and factors such as:



Being self-aware and awareness of where we are now



Working hard after a difficult transition


Being home more often than not also has a subconsciousness/consciousness of work to be hard... causing stress



Fatigue and lower self happiness

things to think about



plan a day and date that (knew about it before now but not as i know it) - maybe give it a try?



write and think about other things isecary-mates-and-friends/ecco/paperback 



These are examples of things that are budgeted to become things that would not be in the case.







Also lessons learned:



Take time to think about things. People tend to like people who have them up their sleeve. 







Also virtual:

I really like companies and am incredibly thankful to be an investor.

I really like working at Cognizantia. I am so immersed into the world of product and services.

I can be silly. I have a beard. I am so immersed into my own mind.

I can be dramatic. I am so immersed into my own mind.

I can be right.

I remember when I cut my hair in the summer, I kept it down by having a field day, having fun in my life, but it gets recycled? People tend to remember me for being silly when I joke around using sarcasm.

Right now, I have a lot of work to do.

Right now, I will keep working hard and carry my backpack to work.

Thank you to my family, friends, co-workers, and the large and small office I have for co-living.

Thank you to my parents, my sister and I.

hiking, biking, hiking (flowing or not flowing), watercoloring, picture making




And I like documenting things with my phone



I wonder what people think of me when I open my eyes and think about my life.

I wonder if my gaze will be more guarded by people who hold more power in my life. 



I wonder if my actions will be seen by those who saw it coming and who remember me for my naivety by accompanying them on adventures of choice.

They will all be scarred by my actions today.

I will thank them in the future with the same reckless energy that drove me to do what I did in high school.

Will they all be scarred by my words? Will they still inspire and carry me to do what I did 25 years ago this way?

Will they
